# Windows operating system optimisations <br/>
- A collection of scripts and configurations to optimise systems running W10 or W11 and increase performance. 

Various power shell scripts covering aspects including:
- Automations
- Windows debloating
- Storage cleaning
- Installers
- Visual customisations
- Program & Game configurations/settings
- GPU settings & Profiles
- Reducing Microsoft spyware/telemetry
- And more to be worked on in future

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Create a Windows restore point beforehand to easily  revert changes made if you encounter problems (Project provides a script to do so "Restore Point.ps1" or you may do it manually through Windows).

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't run scripts blindly if you don't know what you're doing. Most scripts come with revert options but to be safe, ensure you know the functionality of scripts before running, failure to do so may lead to unwanted changes, misconfiguration, corruption etc (Use created restore point if required).
